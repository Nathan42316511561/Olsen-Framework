Using the gear script generator:
//Put this line into the "On Act." field of a trigger and set Activation to "AnyBody"
//When you or any unit run into the trigger area the gear script for the activating unit
//will be exported here: "C:\Users\"your name"\AppData\Local\ArmA 2 OA\arma2oa.RPT"
//I recommend deleting everything inside the text file before doing this.
//an easy way of getting to the file location is to write "%appdata%" in a folders destination
//and it will take you to: "C:\Users\"your name"\AppData\Roaming"

_null = [this] execVM "utility\gearExport.sqf";


Giving units a custom loadout:
//Put this line in the units init. As an example "FL" will give him the loadout 
//of "FL" in the \customization\gear.sqf and "1.1" will name the units squad "1.1".
//all units in the squad must have the same squad name to make sure it’s consistent
//even if no one slots as squad leader. This refers to the unit itself.

[this, "FL", "1.1"] call GEARSCRIPT;


Giving vehicles a custom loadout:
//Put this line in the units init. As an example "HUMMVEE" will give the vehicle, the loadout 
//of "HUMMVEE" in the \customization\vehGear.sqf and this refers to the unit itself.

[this, "HUMMVEE"] call VEHGEARSCRIPT;


Setting the name of a unit on the breifing screen:
//In the description write the units breifing screen name. Example "1.1 Squad Leader".


Setting the name of squads (not visible on breifing screen):
//This is done in the "Giving units a custom loadout:".


Adding an asset to be tracked on the end screen
//Put these two lines in the object init to have the framework track if it’s 
//disabled or destroyed at the end screen. "Humvee M2" will make its name appear as
//Humvee M2 on the end screen and "WEST" will set it to be tracked as an asset of the WEST team

(vehicle this) setVariable ["vehName", "Humvee M2"];
(vehicle this) setVariable ["vehTeam", "WEST"];
